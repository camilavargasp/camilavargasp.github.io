This project involved two parts. First we had to explore, organize and analyze data on fisheries landings and discards estimates by country and by gear type. As a result of this part of the project I created several visualizations.

The second part of the project was to develop a model to estimate how much fishing gear goes into the ocean based on how much fish is being captured. To present part of the results of this model, I developed an interactive web application was using R Shiny. The goal was to show the data going into the model to calculate derelict fishing gear based on the relationship between catch and effort.
