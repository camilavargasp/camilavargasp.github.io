This project involved two parts. First, we had to explore, organize, and analyze data on fisheries landings and discard estimates by country and gear type. As a result of this part of the project, I created several visualizations.

The second part of the project was to develop a model to estimate how much fishing gear goes into the ocean based on the number of fish captured. To present part of the results of this model, I developed an interactive web application using R Shiny. The goal was to show the data going into the model to calculate derelict fishing gear based on the relationship between catch and effort.
