## My Journey into Data Vis

**May 20, 2024** 

Commmited to make progress in somthing in my life I'm starting this journal.

I'll get back to the long story on how I got here. Today I'm feeling with the urge of start. Get something in motion. I'm still not sure where this is going but following inspiration, need of a change, and really wanting to accomplish something, I decided to write.

The short story. I'm trying to figure out how to grow some skill a skill that can lead me into new opportunities. It was the astral energy of the past new moon in Taurus that impulse me to manifest, decrete this journey. Full moon is almost here do shining light into this project.

Four days ago I listen to a presentation by Alberto Cairo. It was one of those things that I had put on my calendar weeks ago with a very generic title. But with a side note saying "Attend this meeting". It was like my past self new what my future self needed to hear. The presentation was beyond inspiring. So simple, so natural, so complex but so honest that it moved me in a way that id hard to explain.

So here I am. Committed or committing to learn this skill of visualizing data.

Right after the presentation, I subscribed to a coulple of news letters as a starting point. I'm still trying to figure out what this commitment will look like, What does being committed mean. IN the meantime I want to accomplish two things: 1. Allocate time in my week to this topic 2. Document the process

Monday morning routine. Check emails, clear inbox. And there it was, the email that trigger this post.At 6 am PT this morning [Stephanie Evergreen](https://stephanieevergreen.com/) newsletter was sent out. It is 9 am and I'll dice into it as my first (baby) step into my commitment.

The news letter took me to [Stephanie's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1LjQFNHP3GyVnQ5_WCjcCQ). Why Stephanie? I'm not sure, it was the first thing that pop in my inbox so I want to explore more.

I watch a 5 min video titled "3 2 1 Approach to Better Charts". Take always: - You have 3 seconds to capture your audience attention. You plot should ONLY focus on what it is important. Eg: the difference of two products.

-   Chart have 2 components the Title and the Data. Use the title to guide the data insight you are trying to show. Data DOES NOT speak for it self, so use words effectively!

-   There is always 1 best way to plot your data. The type of plot matters. Each type of chart has different objectives. Examples presented on the video: Two line graph are good for showing trends, waterfall chart is helpful to show change, dumbell charts present differences, scatterplots are great for showing relationships.

Stephanie offers a program called [The Data Visualization Academy](https://stephanieevergreen.com/academy/). An online platform with videos to cruise at your own pace and learn all data vis things. I'm considering on paying (investing) for a course as a way of solidifying my commitment to learn this skill. But still unsure if that if that is the route I want to fo or not and what course I'd pay for. The Academy look very rich in content, so might consider signing up. We'll see.

With this I feel accomplished for my journey day 1. More tomorrow!
