Get something in motion. I’m still not sure where this is going but following inspiration, need of a change, and really wanting to accomplish something, I decided to write.\nThe short story. I’m trying to figure out how to grow some skill a skill that can lead me into new opportunities. It was the astral energy of the past new moon in Taurus that impulse me to manifest, decrete this journey. Full moon is almost here do shining light into this project.\nFour days ago I listen to a presentation by Alberto Cairo. It was one of those things that I had put on my calendar weeks ago with a very generic title. But with a side note saying “Attend this meeting”. It was like my past self new what my future self needed to hear. The presentation was beyond inspiring. So simple, so natural, so complex but so honest that it moved me in a way that id hard to explain.\nSo here I am. Committed or committing to learn this skill of visualizing data.\nRight after the presentation, I subscribed to a coulple of news letters as a starting point. I’m still trying to figure out what this commitment will look like, What does being committed mean. IN the meantime I want to accomplish two things: 1. Allocate time in my week to this topic 2. Document the process\nMonday morning routine. Check emails, clear inbox. And there it was, the email that trigger this post.At 6 am PT this morning Stephanie Evergreen newsletter was sent out. It is 9 am and I’ll dice into it as my first (baby) step into my commitment.\nThe news letter took me to Stephanie’s YouTube Channel. Why Stephanie? I’m not sure, it was the first thing that pop in my inbox so I want to explore more.\nI watch a 5 min video titled “3 2 1 Approach to Better Charts”. Take always: - You have 3 seconds to capture your audience attention. You plot should ONLY focus on what it is important. Eg: the difference of two products.\n\nChart have 2 components the Title and the Data. Use the title to guide the data insight you are trying to show. Data DOES NOT speak for it self, so use words effectively!\nThere is always 1 best way to plot your data. The type of plot matters. Each type of chart has different objectives. Examples presented on the video: Two line graph are good for showing trends, waterfall chart is helpful to show change, dumbell charts present differences, scatterplots are great for showing relationships.\n\n\nStephanie offers a program called The Data Visualization Academy. An online platform with videos to cruise at your own pace and learn all data vis things. I’m considering on paying (investing) for a course as a way of solidifying my commitment to learn this skill. But still unsure if that if that is the route I want to fo or not and what course I’d pay for. The Academy look very rich in content, so might consider signing up. We’ll see.\nWith this I feel accomplished for my journey day 1. More soon!\n\n\n\nA year ago I was on the market for buying a fridge. In my search I found a model called the “bespoke”. Not being an native spekers, somtimes, some things get lost in translation. The Bespoke fridge was colordul and the colors where customisable. Not within budget and not my style of fridge any ways. Months later, I’m watching Cara Thompson’s talk on “Building a Dataviz Design System for a Medical Research Project” and bespoke should up again. Then I’m reading other data viz stuff and there it is “bespoke visualizations”. Mmmm.. there is more to this word that just a fridge model. Bespoke as in data visualization, according to Google “the process of combining data into innovative visualizations to gain new insights”. Sooo, my next logical question (finally): What does bespoke mean? “Specially made for a particular person, organization or purpose” (Cambridge Dictionary). Not only learning data visualization, but English! Bespoke: word of the day!\nMore on bees. Beeswarm plots. Is this a coincidence, probably. Because I think in the English language Bespoke and Beeswarm are not related. But, as a none native speaker, my first inclination is to judge by the sound. Be Be, it all sound like Bee to me. Anyways, Beeswarm plots are a thing: “Bee swarm plots are similar to strip charts and are designed to show the underlying distribution of the data but unlike strip charts, the data is arranged in a way that avoids overlapping” (R Charts) This is how a beeswarm plot looks like int he simplest of it’s forms.\n Does this come from a Bee Swarm?? Probably. More data viz and more English for me. Note to self: Spanish translation of bee swarm is “enjambre de abejas”\nPs. There is looots of information about plots on the R charts site. Here the section for my beloved ggplot2. Ad information about colors in R ."
