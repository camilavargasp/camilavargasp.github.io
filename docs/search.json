My role is to manage, maintain, and develop NCEAS’s growing data science training portfolio and coordinate and conduct training sessions.\nMy primary goal is to empower researchers and environmental professionals to incorporate data science tools when working with data, aiming to help them build reproducible, collaborative, and efficient data workflows.\nI’ve taught workshops on introduction to R and RStudio, literate analysis with Quarto, Git, and GitHub, cleaning and wrangling data, data visualization with ggplot2, performing text analysis in R, working with spatial data in R, introduction to Shiny, Quarto dashboards, and accessing census data with the tidycensus R package.\n\n\n\nData Science/Research Experience\nI’ve worked on a wide range of research projects in the past. Below, I highlight relevant accomplishments.\n\n\nData Manager for the Palmyra Atoll Data Library (PADL)\nI helped mobilize data from “researchers’ computers” to an open data repository, the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI). To successfully achieve this, I had to do quality checks on data sets and transform them to comply with FAIR to the extent possible, and I systematized the process for documenting and producing detailed metadata.\n\n\n\nResearch Data Scientist\n\nProject: North Coast Urchin Trapping\n\nAnalyzed and visualized urchin monitoring data to evaluate effective urchin removal methods.\n\nProject: West Coast Synthesis of Climate Impacts on Marine Fisheries\n\nSystematized and digitized California’s historical fisheries landings data at a port level and built a dataset documenting the spatial and temporal extent of fishery closures on the West Coast.\n\nProject: Synthetic Estimate of Lost Fishing Gear\n\nManaged data describing global catch, effort, discards, and fishing gear used and analyzed and visualized data with R and ggplot2 to inform a model estimating derelict fishing gear.\n\n\n\nOcean Health Index (OHI) Data Science Fellow\nCollaborated with the OHI team to update and format data sets necessary to calculate the 2018 OHI global assessment. During my internship, I had to revise and improve 9+ R scripts using OHI methods to ensure the required functions and data worked properly.\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nMS Environmental Science and Management, Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)\nBS in Biology with a focus on Ecology and Natural Resources, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC), Santiago, Chile"

As a result of this part of the project, I created several visualizations.\n\nDeck with Plots\n\n\nThe second part of the project was to develop a model to estimate how much fishing gear goes into the ocean based on the number of fish captured. To present part of the results of this model, I developed an interactive web application using R Shiny. The goal was to show the data going into the model to calculate derelict fishing gear based on the relationship between catch and effort.\n\nLink to App"

    "text": "“Write what should not be forgotten” (Isabel Allende)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note to readers (or to self)\nI decided to write these reflections as a way of documenting my experience learning new tools and also to hold myself accountable. Here, I gather resources I’ve encountered that are worth sharing, or at least I think they are worth keeping a record of.\n\n\n\n\n\n3-2-1 approach to better charts\n\nFour days ago, I listened to a presentation by Alberto Cairo. It was one of those things I had put on my calendar weeks ago with a generic title but with a side note saying, “Attend this meeting.” It was like my past self knew what my future self needed to listen to. The presentation was beyond inspiring. It was so simple, so natural, so complex, but so honest that it moved me in a way that is hard to explain.\nSo here I am. Committed to improving my skills in visualizing data.\nRight after the presentation, I subscribed to a couple of newsletters as a starting point. I’m still trying to figure out what this commitment will look like and what being committed means. In the meantime, I want to accomplish two things:\n\nAllocate time in my week to this topic\nDocument the process.\n\nMonday morning routine. Check emails and clear inbox. And there it was, the email that triggered this post. At 6 am PT this morning, Stephanie Evergreen newsletter was sent out. It is 9 am, and I’ll dice into it as my first (baby) step into my commitment.\nThe newsletter took me to Stephanie’s YouTube Channel. Why Stephanie? I’m not sure. It was the first thing that popped into my inbox, so I want to explore more.\nI watched a 5-minute video titled “3 2 1 Approach to Better Charts”. Take always:\n\nYou have 3 seconds to capture your audience’s attention. Your plot should ONLY focus on what is important. E.g., the difference between two products.\nChart have 2 components the Title and the Data. Use the title to guide the data insight you are trying to show. Data DOES NOT speak for itself, so use words effectively!\nThere is always 1 best way to plot your data. The type of plot matters. Each type of chart has different objectives. Examples presented on the video: Two line graph are good for showing trends, waterfall chart is helpful to show change, dumbbell charts present differences, scatterplots are great for showing relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephanie offers a program called The Data Visualization Academy. An online platform with videos to cruise at your own pace and learn all data vis things. I’m considering paying (investing) for a course as a way of solidifying my commitment to learning this skill. But I’m still unsure if that is the route I want to go or not and what course I’d pay for. The Academy look very rich in content, so might consider signing up. We’ll see.\nWith this, I feel accomplished for today. More soon!\n\n\n\nBespoke\nA year ago, I was on the market for buying a fridge. In my search, I found a model called the “bespoke.” Not being a native speaker, sometimes, some things get lost in translation. The Bespoke fridge was colorful and the colors were customizable. Not within budget and not my style of fridge anyway. Months later, I’m watching Cara Thompson’s talk on “Building a Dataviz Design System for a Medical Research Project,” and bespoke showed up again. Then I’m reading other data viz stuff, and there it is: “bespoke visualizations.” Mmmm.. there is more to this word than just a fridge model. Bespoke as in data visualization, according to Google “the process of combining data into innovative visualizations to gain new insights”. Sooo, my next logical question (finally): What does bespoke mean? “Specially made for a particular person, organization or purpose” (Cambridge Dictionary). Not only learning data visualization but English! Bespoke: word of the day!\nMore on bees. Beeswarm plots. Is this a coincidence? Probably. I think Bespoke and Beeswarm are not related in the English language. But, as a none native speaker, my first inclination is to judge by the sound. Be Be, it all sounds like Bee to me. Anyways, Beeswarm plots are a thing: “Bee swarm plots are similar to strip charts and are designed to show the underlying distribution of the data but unlike strip charts, the data is arranged in a way that avoids overlapping” (R Charts) This is what a beeswarm plot looks like in the simplest of its forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this come from a Bee Swarm?? Probably. More data viz and more English for me. Note to self: The Spanish translation of bee swarm is “enjambre de abejas”\nPs. There is lots of information about plots on the R charts site. Here is the section for my beloved ggplot2. And information about colors in R .\n\n\n\nTip on charts font size\nAnother email from Stephanie. And I think, why not document this information in my Reflections journal. What I like about this exercise of writing about what I read is that it will help me remember. So here is the deal on font sizes and graphs:\n\nThe graph’s final destination (presentation, report, dashboard, etc.) will determine the font size choice.\nYou may have two versions of your chart, one for a close-up audience and one for a large room.\n\nBe mindful of the setting in which you are going to present your chart. “The smallest font size you can get away with in large room reading circumstances is 20 points.”\nThank you Stephanie!"
