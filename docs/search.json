Inspired to share after my last camping trip on Catalina Island.\n\nIf Once You Have Slept On An Island\nIf once you have slept on an island\nYou’ll never be quite the same;\nYou may look as you looked the day before\nAnd go by the same old name,\nYou may bustle about in street and shop\nYou may sit at home and sew,\nBut you’ll see blue water and wheeling gulls\nWherever your feet may go.\nYou may chat with the neighbors of this and that\nAnd close to your fire keep,\nBut you’ll hear ship whistle and lighthouse bell\nAnd tides beat through your sleep.\nOh! you won’t know why and you can’t say how\nSuch a change upon you came,\nBut once you have slept on an island,\nYou’ll never be quite the same"
