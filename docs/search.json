My role is to manage, maintain, and develop NCEAS’s growing data science training portfolio, as well as coordinating and conducting training sessions.\nMy primary goal is to empower researchers and environmental professionals to incorporate data science tools when working with data, aiming to help them build reproducible, collaborative, and efficient data workflows.\nI’ve taught workshops on introduction to R and RStudio, literate analysis with Quarto, Git and GitHub, cleaning and wrangling data, data visualization with ggplot2, performing text analysis in R, working with spatial data in R, introduction to Shiny, Quarto dashboards, and accessing census data with the tidycensus R package.\n\n\n\nData Science Experience\nIn the past, I’ve worked in a wide range of research projects. Below I highlight relevant accomplishment.\n\n\nData Manager for the Palmyra Atoll Data Library (PADL)\nI helped mobilized data from “researchers’ computers” to an open data repository, the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI). To successfully achieve this I had to do quality check to data sets and transformed them to comply with FAIR to the extent possible and I systematized the process for documenting and producing detailed metadata.\n\n\n\nResearch Data Scientist\n\nProject: North Coast Urchin Trapping\n\nAnalyzed and visualized urchin monitoring data to evaluate effective urchin removal methods.\n\nProject: West Coast Synthesis of Climate Impacts on Marine Fisheries\n\nSystematized and digitized California’s historical fisheries landings data at a port level and built a dataset documenting the spatial and temporal extent of fishery closures on the West Coast.\n\nProject: Synthetic Estimate of Lost Fishing Gear\n\nManaged data describing global catch, effort, discards, and fishing gear used and analyzed and visualized data with R and ggplot2 to inform a model estimating derelict fishing gear.\n\n\n\nOcean Health Index (OHI) Data Science Fellow\nCollaborated with the OHI team to updated and format data sets necessary to calculate the 2018 OHI global assessment. Through my internship I had to revised and improve 9+ R scripts with OHI methods to ensure the necessary functions and data worked properly.\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nMS Environmental Science and Management, Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)\nBS in Biology with a focus in Ecology and Natural Resources, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC), Santiago, Chile"

    "text": "Note to reader (or to self)\nAs a way of documenting my experience when learning new tools and also as a way to keep my self accountable I decided to write these reflections. Here I gather resources I’ve encounter that worth sharing or at least worth keeping a record.\n\n3-2-1 Approach to Better Charts\n\nFour days ago I listen to a presentation by Alberto Cairo. It was one of those things that I had put on my calendar weeks ago with a very generic title. But with a side note saying “Attend this meeting”. It was like my past self new what my future self needed to listen. The presentation was beyond inspiring. So simple, so natural, so complex but so honest that it moved me in a way that is hard to explain.\nSo here I am. Committed to improve my skills for visualizing data.\nRight after the presentation, I subscribed to a couple of news letters as a starting point. I’m still trying to figure out what this commitment will look like, What does being committed mean. In the meantime I want to accomplish two things:\n\nAllocate time in my week to this topic\nDocument the process.\n\nMonday morning routine. Check emails, clear inbox. And there it was, the email that trigger this post. At 6 am PT this morning Stephanie Evergreen newsletter was sent out. It is 9 am and I’ll dice into it as my first (baby) step into my commitment.\nThe news letter took me to Stephanie’s YouTube Channel. Why Stephanie? I’m not sure, it was the first thing that pop in my inbox so I want to explore more.\nI watch a 5 min video titled “3 2 1 Approach to Better Charts”. Take always:\n\nYou have 3 seconds to capture your audience attention. You plot should ONLY focus on what it is important. Eg: the difference of two products.\nChart have 2 components the Title and the Data. Use the title to guide the data insight you are trying to show. Data DOES NOT speak for it self, so use words effectively!\nThere is always 1 best way to plot your data. The type of plot matters. Each type of chart has different objectives. Examples presented on the video: Two line graph are good for showing trends, waterfall chart is helpful to show change, dumbbell charts present differences, scatterplots are great for showing relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephanie offers a program called The Data Visualization Academy. An online platform with videos to cruise at your own pace and learn all data vis things. I’m considering on paying (investing) for a course as a way of solidifying my commitment to learn this skill. But still unsure if that if that is the route I want to fo or not and what course I’d pay for. The Academy look very rich in content, so might consider signing up. We’ll see.\nWith this I feel accomplished for today. More soon!\n\n\nBespoke\nA year ago I was on the market for buying a fridge. In my search I found a model called the “bespoke”. Not being an native spekers, somtimes, some things get lost in translation. The Bespoke fridge was colordul and the colors where customisable. Not within budget and not my style of fridge any ways. Months later, I’m watching Cara Thompson’s talk on “Building a Dataviz Design System for a Medical Research Project” and bespoke should up again. Then I’m reading other data viz stuff and there it is “bespoke visualizations”. Mmmm.. there is more to this word that just a fridge model. Bespoke as in data visualization, according to Google “the process of combining data into innovative visualizations to gain new insights”. Sooo, my next logical question (finally): What does bespoke mean? “Specially made for a particular person, organization or purpose” (Cambridge Dictionary). Not only learning data visualization, but English! Bespoke: word of the day!\nMore on bees. Beeswarm plots. Is this a coincidence, probably. Because I think in the English language Bespoke and Beeswarm are not related. But, as a none native speaker, my first inclination is to judge by the sound. Be Be, it all sound like Bee to me. Anyways, Beeswarm plots are a thing: “Bee swarm plots are similar to strip charts and are designed to show the underlying distribution of the data but unlike strip charts, the data is arranged in a way that avoids overlapping” (R Charts) This is how a beeswarm plot looks like int he simplest of it’s forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this come from a Bee Swarm?? Probably. More data viz and more English for me. Note to self: Spanish translation of bee swarm is “enjambre de abejas”\nPs. There is looots of information about plots on the R charts site. Here the section for my beloved ggplot2. Ad information about colors in R .\n\n\nTip on font size\nAnother email from Stephanie. And I think to my self, why not document this information on my Reflections journal. What I like about this exercise of writing about what I read is that it will help me remember. So here is the deal on font sizes and graphs:\n\nThe graphs final destination (presentation, report, dashboard, etc.) will determine the font size choice.\nYou may have two different versions of your chart, one for a close up audience and one for a large room.\n\nBe mindful of the setting you are going to present you chart. “The smallest font size you can get away with in large room reading circumstances is 20 point.”\nThank you Stephanie!"
