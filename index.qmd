*If once you have slept on an island*

*You'll never be quite the same;*

*You may look as you looked the day before*

*And go by the same old name,*

*You may bustle about in street and shop*

*You may sit at home and sew,*

*But you'll see blue water and wheeling gulls*

*Wherever your feet may go.*

*You may chat with the neighbors of this and that*

*And close to your fire keep,*

*But you'll hear ship whistle and lighthouse bell*

*And tides beat through your sleep.*

*Oh! you won't know why and you can't say how*

*Such a change upon you came,*

*But once you have slept on an island,*

*You'll never be quite the same*

by Rachel Lyman

A poem inspired on my last camping trip to Catalina.
